Hello prospective employers! 

My name is Matt and I was tasked with the Senior TAM take home assignment. This was my initial thought process after viewing the requirements of the assignment: 

I need to quickly create a web form that interacts with the Alloy API, host relevant documentation and code on Github, and be able to explain the app creation and functionality to an audience that may not have a technical background. 

Given the succinct requirements list above, I went about determining what would be the best tool available to me to complete this assignment. After extensively searching the web, I found the perfect tool to use; an application called Retool. Retool allows you to quickly build a fully hosted web application that can interact with an API. 

First I began by designing the form and applying validation rules to each of the input fields. Then I made some creative contributions to the application by creating a clearly fictitious company 'UnlimitedCredit4Life' and stylized the app to be reminiscent of a web page one might find on the internet in the early 2000s. 

Once I had created the front end of the app, it was time to connect the Alloy API. I found this process to be fairly straightforward with the most significant 'gotcha' to be setting retool to pass JSON in the intended format to Alloy. 

Given my background in HTML/CSS/Javascript and REST APIs, I found the experience of this project to be enjoyable and a fun exercise. 

I have also included a branch in this repository with code snippets that I used to create various validations and logic for the app. You will also find a brief video demonstration beneath the README in the main branch. 

If you would like to request access to the Retool project, please send an email to me personally at mprov93@gmail.com 

Cheers, 
Matt
